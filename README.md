- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnnaOne88
- 👀 I’m interested in Python. I like to automate tasks because why the hell not. Life is too short.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and HTML, because I want to be able to make a website from scratch! Just for fun.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any hobby projects that automate tasks.
- 📫 How to reach me: annaonesork@gmail.com
